# CDevGuidelines
CDevGuidelines is a personal repository of guidelines, conventions and principles to follow when writing and developing software and programs. It may also apply to the use of third-party softwares.

## Practical Application
These rules are meant to be applied with a degree of flexibility, especially in specific contexts where reason or necessity takes precedence over the stated conventions.

The purpose of this collection is to provide structure, consistency, and coherence to the development process, without restricting the developer’s creativity or autonomy.
